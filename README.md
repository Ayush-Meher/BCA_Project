# Farming Code: Learn Programming Through Farming üå±

An interactive 3D farming game designed to teach programming concepts through a fun and engaging farming simulation. Players learn to code by controlling a farming drone to plow, plant, and harvest crops using Python-like commands.

## üéØ Educational Purpose

This project aims to teach programming concepts through practical application:

1. **Basic Programming Concepts**
   - Functions and parameters
   - Variables and data types
   - Control flow (if/else statements)
   - Loops and iteration
   - Code organization and functions

2. **Problem-Solving Skills**
   - Breaking down tasks into steps
   - Planning and automation
   - Debugging and error handling
   - Logical thinking

3. **Progressive Learning Path**
   - Start with simple commands
   - Build up to complex automation
   - Learn through practical examples
   - Get immediate visual feedback

  - Intuitive drone controls

- **Progressive Tutorial System**
  - Step-by-step learning path
  - Interactive code examples
  - Real-time code validation
  - Helpful feedback and hints

- **Farming Mechanics**
  - Plow tiles to prepare for planting
  - Plant different types of crops
  - Monitor crop growth
  - Harvest when ready
  - Expand your farm

- **Programming Interface**
  - Python-like syntax

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

1. **Prerequisites**
   ```bash
   Node.js (v14 or higher)
   npm (v6 or higher)
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/farming-code.git
   cd farming-code
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Starting the Game**
   - Open the game in your browser
   - The tutorial will guide you through the basics
   - Follow the step-by-step instructions

2. **Basic Commands**
   ```python
   # Plow a tile
   plow(0)  # Plows the first tile (index 0)

   # Plant a crop
   plant(0, 'wheat')  # Plants wheat on tile 0

   # Check if a crop is ready
   if is_ready(0):
       harvest(0)  # Harvests the crop on tile 0

   # Move the drone
   move(0, 0)  # Moves to coordinates (0,0)
   ```

3. **Advanced Concepts**
   ```python
   # Using loops to farm multiple tiles
   for i in range(5):
       plow(i)
       plant(i, 'wheat')

   # Creating functions
   def farm_row(start, end, crop_type):
       for i in range(start, end):
           if not is_plowed(i):
               plow(i)
           plant(i, crop_type)

   # Smart farming with conditions
   for i in range(10):
       if is_plowed(i):
           if has_crop(i):
               if is_ready(i):
                   harvest(i)
           else:
               plant(i, 'corn')
       else:
           plow(i)
   ```
